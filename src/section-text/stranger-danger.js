    "value": `While Sparky brings ample entertainment and joy, he comes from an unknown haunted past as a rescue and has some behavior issues. Sparky loves his family unit but has stranger danger, especially when people come over. Generally when we have company over, we keep him in his preferred upstairs room for the sake of himself and company. For extended company or people he sees regularly, we do let him out with his muzzle on. He’s fine with people on walks outside but you will have to get used to telling people no, you can’t pat him. Be extra cautious around people who are self-proclaimed ‘good with dogs’ who want to pat him (aka people who only have experience with dogs without behavioral issues).`,
