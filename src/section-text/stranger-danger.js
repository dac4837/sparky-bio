  value: `While Sparky brings ample entertainment and joy, he comes from an unknown haunted past as a rescue and has some behavior issues. Sparky loves his family unit but has stranger danger, especially when people come over to his “home turf”. Generally when we have company over, we keep him away in his preferred upstairs room for the sake of himself and company. For extended company or people he sees regularly, we do let him out with his muzzle on. Self-proclaimed “dog people” often try to get too friendly too quickly with him, so we instruct visitors to give him space and not too much attention.
    
    He’s fine with strangers on walks outside but he counts on you to not let strangers invade his personal space— say a clear “no” to folks wanting to pat him. He should not spend any time with children.
