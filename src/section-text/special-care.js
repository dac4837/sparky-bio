`Sparky does need some special care with his handling. In general he tends to be the best with his trusted alpha but will be more reserved with others, even other loved ones. In general Sparky does not like being patted or touched but will tolerate pretty much anything from his trusted alpha and in small doses from other loved ones. (This doesn’t stop him from wanting to be with you or on a lap though!) 
Sparky does have a history of biting but it’s become pretty rare now and can be avoided by doing the following:
    * Read his signals. If he lowers his head/ears or if he bares his teeth (usually when you’re really in his space), he’s telling you to back off
    * Keep food separate: have his own eating space and your own eating space (we have him “settle” on his dog bed while we eat dinner)
    * Separate him and guests. If you have company over, it’s generally best to have him elsewhere or muzzled
    * Sparky will be more on edge if you enter his space when he was previously alone (if he was napping in the bedroom, etc). You can have him come over/do a trick to snap him out of it.
    
    Sparky should not be trusted with children or children around Sparky.`,
