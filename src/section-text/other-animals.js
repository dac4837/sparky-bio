  value: `Sparky does well with dogs who he’s friends with but can get frazzled when spotting other dogs on the street. He’s good with small and calm dogs across the street but gets riled up when confronting dogs larger than him or when other dogs are paying him attention. When we see another dog coming down the street, we will try to cross to the other side, distract him with tricks/treats, or occasionally pick him up to avoid a confrontation. 
    Introducing him to a new friend may take some time as he will want to assert himself but is always eager to see his previous acquaintances. Sparky does have some experience with cats but would do best in a home without cats or with a cat who keeps to themselves. He’s mostly curious but will be riled up and will chase if instigated.
