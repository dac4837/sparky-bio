  value: `Sparky, like any dog, needs services such as the vet/grooming. The vet isn’t too bad as you can put his muzzle on and distract him with cheese sticks while the vet is giving him his shots, etc. He will be a lot better if you’re there so if covid measures are still in place, insist on an exception or an outside examination so you can be with him.
    Sparky does have a groomer in Westbrook Maine that I’ve been taking him to for a while now. Historically I’ve been there to make him more comfortable but he is likely comfortable enough with Melissa at this point to be dropped off.`,
