    value:  `Sparky loves his humans. He will nearly insist on being in the same room and ideally on someone's lap. If allowed, he would be cuddled up with you at night [he does sleep in his crate but we let him out for morning cuddles after the first alarm] and for every nap. He Loves camping since he's allowed to sleep in the tandem sleeping bag.

Sparky loves playing with his toys and can be found some evenings running while whipping around his bear, cupcake, football, or whatever the latest toy he received from grandma. He enjoys a good game of fetch as well! (Just let him or have him drop it for you first). He also enjoys play time and horsing around with people he's comfortable with but will settle for tackling the bed sheets as his owners are attempting to change them with him on them. Sparky enjoys running around in a yard and walks but will start getting tired after a few miles. 

At the end of the day, his all-time favorite activity is being with the people he loves. Sparky is a little shadow and can be found in a near-by basket, on a lap, or next to you on a couch. Sparkyâ€™s favorite evening activity is movie night being nestled between his owners.`,
