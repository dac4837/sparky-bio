    value:  `Sparky is an older dog who likes to relax with his favorite humans! He plays with his toys on his own, and enjoys a good game of fetch as well (Just let him drop the toy before you pick it up). Sparky enjoys walks but will start getting tired after a few miles. At the end of the day, his all-time favorite activity is being with the people he loves. Sparky is a little shadow and can be found napping in a near-by basket, on a lap, or next to you on the couch. His favorite evening activity is movie night being nestled between his owners.`,
