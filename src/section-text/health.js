    "value": `Sparky is in overall good health for his age! As a rescue we don’t have an exact age but the estimation at adoption was 3y making him 8 years old (we declared his birthday to be September 8, 2013). He sleeps a lot during the day but is still plenty active and up for activities. He takes fluoxetine for his anxiety which has helped a lot. He also takes apoquel for allergies (he used to bite his fur/scratch). His only other health abnormality is he gets a recurring split nail on one of his front dorsal nails that needs to be pulled. If he’s biting his paw a lot in that area, it’s worth taking him in to get that looked at as it can be very painful.`,
